# Abattoir

## What's This?
Abattoir is a collection of infrastructure as code (IaC) for my Kubernetes homelab.

## What's Your Homelab?
At the moment, it's five [RockPro64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=61454) using equipment from [PicoCluster](https://www.picocluster.com/collections/rockpro64/products/pico-5-rockpro64).

## Why Abattoir?
With a focus on IaC for my lab I hope to exhibit the principle of "cattle not kittens" for my infrastructure, where there are no specialized servers and anything can be replaced quickly and easily. I would say no actual cattle were harmed in the creation of this, but I've been on a burger kick lately.
